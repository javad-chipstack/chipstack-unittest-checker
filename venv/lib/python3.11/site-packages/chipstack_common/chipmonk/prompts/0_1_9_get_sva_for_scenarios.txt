Respond only with code snippet in systemverilog.

Consider the following RTL writting in systemverilog:
```systemverilog
$design_code
```

You are asked to write a systemverilog assertion for the following scenario:
$scenario

What is the systemverilog assertion for the above scenario? Add any auxiliary logic if needed.
Generate only one assertion in a single systemverilog code block enclosed in ```systemverilog```.

Use "generate for loop" to define multiple assertions when you see indices and you need to iterate over them.
