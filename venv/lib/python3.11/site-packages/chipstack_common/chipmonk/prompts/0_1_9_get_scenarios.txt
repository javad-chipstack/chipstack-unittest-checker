Consider the following RTL written in Systemverilog:
```systemverilog
$design_code
```

Your task is to generate important scenarios to test in the above RTL with formal verification. $group_wise_instruction

$port_details

Write as many important scenarios as necessary. Be specific. Use the above port names whenever needed. Each scenario must use at least one Output Port. First generate a step-by-step reasoning And generate scenarios that are implementable in code. Respond in the following JSON list format:
```json
[{"thought": "<step-by-step reasoning on how you arrived at this scenario>", "scenario": "Assert that when <pre-condition>, then <check>"}, ...]
```
